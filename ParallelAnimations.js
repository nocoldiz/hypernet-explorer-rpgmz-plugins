/*:
 * @target MZ
 * @pluginname ParallelBattleAnimations
 * @author Claude
 * @desc Allows battle animations to play in parallel while battle continues
 * @help 
 * This plugin modifies the battle system to allow animations to play
 * in parallel with other actions, rather than waiting for each animation
 * to complete before continuing to the next turn.
 * 
 * No plugin parameters needed.
